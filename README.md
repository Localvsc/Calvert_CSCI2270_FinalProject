# Calvert_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project for CSCI 2270.

Name: Lucas Calvert
Partners: None

Description:
	My project is to extend the functionality of Assignment 4 from
earlier this semester. I will implement 4-5 new methods in the
CommunicationNetwork class and update some of the previous methods.

Goals for the update:
1) Read city names from a file and create the network from them.
2) Add the ability to create multiple networks at the same time.
3) Add the ability to merge networks at a given linkage point.
4) Add distances between cities (given in text file that creates network).
4) "Deliver" a message to a certain city and determine distance the message traveled.
5) Determine total length of network
